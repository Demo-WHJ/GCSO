# GOAL:
In Class 20, you learned how to evaluate if two sprites have collided.
In this project, you have to make a simulator that can test car reliability.

# Story:
The Global Car Safety Organisation tests cars for safety and reliability in the event of a crash.
Based upon the weight and speed of the car, the deformation of the car is calculated using the formula below.

# Examples:
- Any deformation greater than 180 is considered lethal for the passengers.
- Any deformation between 80 and 180 is considered average.
- Deformation below 80 is considered good.
You have to help the CGSO by creating a simulator to collide a car sprite with a wall and calculate the damage.
